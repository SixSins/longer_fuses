# Longer Fuses

A Minecraft datapack for 1.15+. Extends creepers' fuse times to make them easier to kill before they explode.

Increases the fuse time from 1.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds.

This is a compromise between turning the `mobGriefing` gamerule off (which also disables villager breeding/harvesting) and setting creepers' explosion radius to 0 (causing them to deal no damage).

## Installation

Download this datapack as a zip file. Place it into the `datapacks` folder inside of your save folder. Run `/reload` or reload the world for the datapack to take effect.

On Realms, you'll need to download your world in order to install, and then upload it after you copy the datapack over.

## Uninstall

Simply remove this datapack from your `datapacks` folder. That's it!
